# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Disbots

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a discord bot(s) where it allows the user to interact with it and be able to use it's specific functions. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be coded in python. The software will allow the bot(s) to give the user the weather of a certain place when asked, a specific quote from an artist, or give the user their upcoming assignments on cavans. The weather bot for example will be able to tell the user the temperature of a certain place the user asks. The quote bot will have a list of different quotes either in a document added by me or from an API key from a website. Another bot can be a general server maintence bot who adds roles to users, warns users, etc. All of this can be possibly incorportated into one bot but it has to be looked into further. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for this project will be having all 2 bots properly working preferably the weather bot and the general server maintence or quote bot. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for this project will be having all 4 bots working. The weather, maintience bot, the quote and the canvas bot. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be all 4 bot features all in one bot. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills I will be to acquire is importing different aspects such as the bot and then working in discord inorder to add the bot. I will also need to learn how to add an api key inorder for the bot to gather information to give out to the user. I will need to research how a discord bot works and what is needed inorder to have it function. I will also need to learn how to link the discord bot to my account and link it to other servers. My frist steps are to go on youtube and find a video that outlines how the bot works and how to make one. Then afterwards I will add my own designs to the bot to get it to do what I want.
